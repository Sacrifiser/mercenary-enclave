# Introduction, after special project or timer
merc.introduction.desc: "Greetings! Let us just get right to it: the use of mercenaries in warfare has a long history. Much longer, in fact, than the deployment of national militaries to wage wars.\n\n$merc.name.colored$ is a business just like any other. We can be contracted to perform a wide array of combat maneuvers, logistics, armed security, and ground combat training.\n\nFor a price."

merc.buyer.detected.desc: "We're being hailed by the head of our interior ministry: §H\"[Root.GetRulerTitle], we can confidently report that §!§Y[fmerc_buyer.GetName]§!§H has recently conducted a covert operation against us through §!$merc.name.colored$§H.

merc.stationoffer.title: "Allow station access?"
merc.stationoffer.desc: "Greetings, [root.GetRulerName]! We here at $merc.name.colored$ would like to offer you an exciting business opportunity!\n\nIt would be to our mutual benefit if you were to §Gallow us access§! to construct an operations outpost inside your borders.\n\nWe realise that this might seem intimidating, or sneaky, so we are prepared to offer you some compensation to grease the wheels of bureaucracy, so to speak:\n\n£energy §G2500§!\n£minerals §G500§!\n\nThis deal only comes once in a lifetime, so weigh your decision accordingly."

# insurance
merc.insurance.title: "Friendly alert"

Another valued customer has ordered an operation against your empire through our services menu.\n\nThis operation is already under way, and our fleets have entered your subspace. Rest assured they are effective.\n\nDue to our non-disclosure agreements with all our customers, this is the only information we will provide on the subject.\n\nSince your insurance policy allows you to make a counter-offer, you may do so now, at a 25% discount. If you accept the offer, our operations will be terminated immediately."

merc.insurance.prevented: "We regret to inform you that the target you selected for your last order has invoked their insurance policy with $merc.name.colored$, and as such, if we had an ongoing operation against them on your behalf - which we're not saying we do, or did - then it would be terminated immediately.\n\nHave a nice day."

merc.operations.desc: "We at $merc.name.colored$ provide several special combat operations for our customers. Feel free to browse our brochure!\n\nPlease read the descriptions carefully, and sign on the dotted line.\n§YWhiteout Enterprise§! operations have several parameters that will remain outside any clients control, the most important of which is timing. After you sign up for a service, it might take anywhere from 3 days to 90 days before the operation starts. This allows us to plan carefully, and is not up for negotiation."

# Spaceports service
merc.spaceport.name: "Attack Spaceport"
merc.spaceport.desc: "After you have selected the target country and some other operational parameters, $merc.name.colored$ will locate and destroy one or more Spaceport facilities on your behalf.

# Liberate Planet
merc.liberation.name: "Liberate Planet"
merc.liberation.desc: "Planet liberation is always risky business, and has an immense upfront cost - but the payoff is exceptional. If you select this option, $merc.name.colored$ finds a suitable target planet to invade, and does all the dirty work for you.

# Mining/Research Raid
merc.raid.name: "Mining/Research Raid"
merc.raid.desc: "Want to stifle an adversaries economy? This option is for you. After you set up the menial operational parameters of the raid, $merc.name.colored$ will locate, engage, and destroy, between 5 and 12 mining/research stations in your adversaries space. Obviously, any loot we find is ours to keep."

# Fleet Battle
merc.fleet.name: "Fleet Raid"
merc.fleet.desc: "The most dangerous operation we can undertake. This puts us inevitably in direct confrontation with enemy admirals and leadership, and is thus the chance of capture is extremely high. However, this is what we live for, what we work for. If you select this service, $merc.name.colored$ will locate, identify, track, and engage, a minimum of 1 (one) hostile fleet of at least size 20 or more. If we can not find a fleet this big, we will find the toughest one."

# Clear Space
merc.clearspace.name: "Clear Space"
merc.clearspace.desc: "Are pirates, drones, amoebas, or some other annoying monstrous hostile lounging about inside your territory? $merc.name.colored$ can handle that for you. For a price!\n\nSelect the type of target you want us to §Rimmediately§! engage in our services menu on the right, and let us get to work. §GThere is no red tape on this one.§!\n\nCost: £minerals §GBetween 300 and 3000§!\nChance of success: §G95%§!\n"

merc.clearspace.tooltip: "$merc.name.colored$ will §Rimmediately§! go to work on any hostile targets matching this description inside your territories. If there are no targets of this type, your minerals will be considered a donation.\n\nThe cost will vary depending on several factors, but $merc.name.colored$ sees this service as a friendly gesture among trusted customers, and will simply §Gdeduct the cost from your account§! after the operation has been completed."

# Question 1, which country should we attack
merc.target.name: "Target Selection"
merc.target.desc: "The very first parameter we need to know is what kind of target you want to select. $merc.name.colored$ has an internal classification system for most kinds of empires that can be found thriving around the galaxy.\n\nEach classification type comes with bonuses and/or penalties to the final operational costs.\n\nDue to standard non-disclosure agreements with all our clients, you will only be able to select targets which your own country has identified.

merc.target.selected.fallen: "You selected: §GFallen Empires§!.\n\nFallen Empires are stagnant or awakened ancient empires that have been present in the galaxy as long as time itself.

Therefore, our prices are lowered for this target. Because of their strength, however, the chances of success drop dramatically.

merc.disguise.desc: "§Y[fmerc_target_country.GetName]§! will never know what hit them.\n\nThe next operational parameter you need to decide is what kind of disguise we should apply on our fleet. The available choices all have bonuses and penalties, so please choose carefully."
